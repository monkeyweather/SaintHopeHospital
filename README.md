# SaintHopeHospital
VR Project by Shane, Adrian, Jessica

Instructions: There is a downloadable zip file on google drive with a build of our project. It can be ran through unity or using the sln file and having a VR headset connected and running it through local machine. 

Walk down the hallway slowly, look in rooms if you like, be careful not to walk through walls. Keep walking and listening until you reach the end of the hallway, listen to the speech as you walk towards the monster, and then exit. 

The initial idea for this project was a horror hospital game with a lot of different changes as the player went along, slowly building tension until the final moment. Issues that came up, that ended up preventing that and causing it to be more of a walk through experience as you hear the hospital falling off the rails, and finally confronting the evil doctor. A major problem that came up was that many of these projects and steps along the way required other members to complete things before each of us could start working on our own things. In the future, a plan where we each could work more on our own section of the project and come together would have been a lot more doable. The original plans eventually got simplified and many animations or changes that were planning to be made occur were not done in time. However, the end experience is still a fairly disturbing one, as the effects and tone created along the way ended up being fairly effective at creating a creepy hospital feel.
